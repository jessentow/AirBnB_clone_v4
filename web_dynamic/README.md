Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Based on web_flask, copy: web_flask/static, web_flask/templates/100-hbnb.html, web_flask/__init__.py and web_flask/100-hbnb.py into the web_dynamic folder
Rename 100-hbnb.py to 0-hbnb.py
Rename 100-hbnb.html to 0-hbnb.html
Update 0-hbnb.py to replace the existing route to /0-hbnb/
If 100-hbnb.html is not present, use 8-hbnb.html instead
